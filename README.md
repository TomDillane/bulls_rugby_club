able to join and optionally select a team as a player. Returning players must 
be able to log in and edit their profile.

 the users to become members, edit their own information only and keep up to date
 in club affairs. 
 The site will include:
 + Home page with club overview
 + Latest news on club and team including results
 + Team details
 + Log in option for members
